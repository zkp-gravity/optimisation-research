# This function requires more unique parameters than the Dietzfelbinger multiply-shift hash function, but avoids arithmetic

#  xv: A bitvector to be hashed to an integer
#  m: An array of arrays of length equivalent to the length of xv, with entries of size equivalent to the hash size

# Implements a Bloom filter, a data structure for approximate set membership
# A Bloom filter can return one of two results: "possibly a member", and "definitely not a member"
# The risk of false positives increases with the number of elements stored relative to the underlying array size
# This implementation generalizes the basic concept to incorporate the notion of bleaching from WNN research
# With bleaching, we replace seen/not seen bits in the data structure with counters
# Elements can now be added to the data structure multiple times
# Our results now become "possibly added at least <b> times" and "definitely added fewer than <b> times"
# Increasing the bleaching threshold (the value of b) can improve accuracy
# Once the final bleaching threshold has been selected, this can be converted to a traditional Bloom filter
#  by evaluating the predicate "d[i] >= b" for all entries in the filter's data array
