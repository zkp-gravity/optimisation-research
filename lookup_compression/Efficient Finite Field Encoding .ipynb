    "# Efficiently Provable Bit Decoding in a Finite Field\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we provide an implementation of a protocol that can generate proofs for the value of the $i^{th}$ bit of $n$ bits encoded in a single field element.\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol operates within finite field arithmetic, leveraging the property that some numbers have square roots while others don't, as a mechanism to encode bits into a field element.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The protocol's intent is to take $n$ bits, encode them into a single field element, and subsequently allow for a proof that a given $i^{th}$ bit of the encoded $n$ bits was indeed either a 1 or a 0. Impressively, our protocol requires only a single constraint to provide this proof for the $i^{th}$ bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the protocol is to allow to compress binary lookup tables, as well as speed up the bit decomposition. Binary lookup tables, such as ones storing a function $f$ evaluation from domain of $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$, usually need a single field field to store each evaluation. Our protocol allows to reduce the row size by a factor of n with a single additional constraint per looked up value by compressing multiple consequtive evaluations into a single field value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-processing \n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of this protocol relies on a precomputation step that establishes the encoding table. Once computed, this table is universally applicable and doesn't require subsequent recalculations. Currently, the computation time for this table, given $n$ bits, is approximately $O(4^n)$, with the table size also being $O(2^n)$. We anticipate that future refinements may significantly enhance this efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Post the precomputation step, the encoding of $n$ bits is straightforward. It involves looking up the encoding for the bit set in the previously calculated table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider we want to encode bits `[1, 0, 1]`. Then we will find $x$, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ has a square root\n",
    "- $x + 1$ does not\n",
    "- $x + 2$ does not\n",
    "- $x + 3$ does\n",
    "- $x + 4$ does\n",
    "- $x + 5$ does not\n",
    "\n",
    "This indeed requires briteforsing to find the encoding. However, using the encoding table we do not need to repeat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoding process for the $i^{th}$ bit requires examining whether the sum of the encoding field element $\\text{enc_v}$ and $2 \\times i$ is a square. If true, the bit decodes to $1$; if the sum of the encoding field element $\\text{enc_v}$ and $2 \\times i + 1$ is a square, the bit decodes to $0$. If neither condition is met, the decoding is deemed invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proving\n",
    "\n",
    "The utilization of the square root property is central to our decision-making process primarily because of its verifiability. If a prover supplies the square root of a number, it's feasible to validate with one constraint that the number indeed has a square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalizing on this, our protocol can assert that the value of the $i^{th}$ bit was indeed a $1$ (or $0$) by verifying that $ \\text{root}^2 == \\text{enc_v} + 2 \\times i + 1 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the entirety of the $n$ bits can be decoded with a mere $n$ constraints.\n"
